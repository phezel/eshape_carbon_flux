    "## Demonstration of calculation of surface ocean CO$_2$ fluxes \n",
    "BCDC/pjh 2022-05\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook outlines/demonstrates calculation of CO$_2$ fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere.  Positive is defined by default as from the ocean to the atmosphere.  An overview of bulk gas flux calculation and parameterizations involved is given in Wanninkhof (2014), and briefly outlined here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short the bulk gas transfer equation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rm F = k\\, K_o\\, (pCO_{2w}-pCO_{2a})$$  \n",
    "$\\rm F$ is the flux (mass area$^{-1}$ time${-1}$), $\\rm k$ is the gas transfer velocity (length time$^{-1}$), $\\rm K_o$ is the solubility (mass volume $^{-1}$ pressure$^{-1}$), and $\\rm pCO_2$ the relative partial pressures in water (ocean) and atmosphere respectively.  timetime\n",
    "\n",
    "The gas transfer velocity k is usually expressed as a parameterization as a function of 10 m wind speed, with a secondary dependence surface temperature through the Schmidt number. The solubility $\\rm K_o$ is a function of temperature and salinity. The partial pressure differences ($\\rm \\Delta pCO_2$) also depend on temperature and salinity, and ocean CO$_2$measurements are often expressed in terms of fugacity $\\rm fCO_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates calculation of CO$_2$ fluxes though a step-by-step process, beginnning from import of input datasets.  Much of the challenge in making global, regional, and temporal calculations of CO$_2$ fluxes involve technical issues in working with large input data sets from different sources on different spatial and temporal resolutions.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Technical challenges include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  pCO$_2$/fCO$_2$ data is sampled on sparse spatial and temporal scales, often with very high frequency for short periods of time, from multiple different sources.  SOCAT and GLODAP are two data sources for harmonized fCO$_2$ measurements, with useful metadata and harmonization information as well as quality control already performed.  The SOCAT monthly gridded atlas contains (sparse) aggregated data on a regular grid, and is used in the first iteration of this notebook.     \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The gas transfer velocity, k, depends on wind speed and sea surface temperature and requires either simultaneous observations of wind speed at 10-m and sea surface temperature (not usually available), or use of reanalysis products with appropriate spatial and temporal scales.  The files for these reanalysis products are usually very large, especially if daily or sub-daily data is used, for which only a subset is often needed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  There are multiple parameterizations for the gas transfer velocity, k, developed over past decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Proper treatment of solubility, $\\rm K_o$, also requires sea surface temperature and salinity.   \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Atmospheric pCO$_2$ measurements are also not generally simulataneous with ocean fCO$_2$ measurements.  The NOAA Greenhouse Gas  Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) Reference xCO$_2$ product can be used, on the assumption that the MBL CO$_2$ concentration is well mixed.  This product is a zonally averaged boundary layer CO$_2$ concentration based on global station observations in zonal band widths of sine(latitude) = 0.5 and an 8-day frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Proper treatment of xCO$_2$ to pCO$_2$ depends on surface atmospheric pressure and surface relative humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Temporal and spatial mismatches between the input data (pCO$_2$, reanalysis data, xCO$_2$) requires either  grid coordinate harmonization and/or grid and temporal interpolation. \n",
    "\n",
    "8.   Interpolation and subsequent interpretation of calculated CO$_2$ fluxes at specific points and integrated over time to obtain regional and global estimates of time-integrated fluxes is not trivial.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of these challenges are addressed in the the calculations here, and in fact several of them are neglected.  However, the point at which each should be addressed is noted in the code, and examples should allow researchers to effectively make modifications to the parts deemed important.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some details and caveats of data structures specific to the Python packages and libraries used here (for a user not fully versed in Python, and from the perspective of a Matlab user) are also highlighted in the code examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is meant to be an open-source project, and so users are encouraged to develop and submit suggestions and updates via GitHub and ______.   \n",
